# Overview

I wanted to create a website that allowed users to look at a variety of different celestial objects. 

This software displays the Iridium satellites and their locations.

I wanted to allow people to track where celestial objects are at in teh sky.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and ArcGIS online. 

I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also used the n2yo.com site to get satellite poition and the Celestrak API to get satellite data.
